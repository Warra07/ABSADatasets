The only reason I gave this only 3 stars is because the Week 3 [ASP]videos[ASP] did not match up to the content instruction. This made it difficult and confusing. Not sure when it will be fixed. !sent! Negative
A nice introduction to the open source [ASP]tools[ASP]. Not much programming, but a good starting point at least on Markdown usage. Hopefully the certification will get more difficult with time! !sent! Positive
IBM watson studio [ASP]videos[ASP] are outdated. Ibm platform has been updated and the videos do not correspond to the current version making it difficult to follow. this should be improved !sent! Negative
The [ASP]content[ASP] could be updated for the current IBM Watson Studio user interface. It was difficult to follow the instructor. Also SPSS Modeler tutorial there was no way to practice !sent! Negative
